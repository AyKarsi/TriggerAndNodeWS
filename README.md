Simple showcase project to showcase the basic process of building a Trigger.IO app which consumes data from a Node.js Webservice.
Note: Code is the result of live coding session and there is no guarantee that everthing will work :) 

Requires the Trigger.IO tools installed. 
Requires node.js, with the Express library.
